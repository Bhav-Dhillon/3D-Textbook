Why are there two init functions? One is a seperate file and the other is inside the App.tsx file.

Section 2 model shouldnt have the soccer ball pattern turned on.

Fix background music looping problem.

Add ability to go backwards

Camera movements(translate) need to be slowed down?

Text needs to be added for all the sections. 

All buckball's material needs to be shifted to black. Glossy black?

Camera transitions need to be smoothed out, potentially slowed down a bit.
Last camera transition need to be re-thought. 

Change voice 1 ("gas" needs to end less abruptly)...might cost $50 though.

Hook back into home page. 

Make sure all other lessons are working.


// Add sound effects between camera movements, perhaps a whoosh of some kind, but obviously fitting the space theme.
// Need to refine jank on fullerene opening animation. Tai can likely help here. Its likely a garbage collection bottleneck. I believe frames have 8ms to render to not have any jank @120fps.
