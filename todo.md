1. Finish re-design of  lesson selection page.
      - Add thumbnails.
            - Make nanotube thumbnail with #11 -- add more lighting (overhead like fullerene) and give more "padding" clearance so that it matches the fullerene.
                  - Try matte material too.


      - Make diamond thumbnail 
      - Make all the other filler thumbnails




2. Fix flipped model bug.
3. Figure out new camera movement.
3. Add animation to text.
4. Add voice over for text.
5. Make more cinematic with fade to black intro scene + add gentle spinners like monovn?

2. Lerp the soccer pattern color change.
3. Trim * imports on Three.
4. Write your own inSphere method.
