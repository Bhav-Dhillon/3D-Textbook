                    <p>The result? Novel cage-like molecules composed of 60 carbon atoms, joined together to form a hollow sphere. The largest and most symmetrical form of pure carbon ever discovered.

                They have extraordinary chemical and physical properties. Fullerenes are exceedingly rugged and are even capable of surviving the extreme temperatures of outer space. And because they are essentially hollow cages, they can be manipulated to make materials never before known.</p>
