                <p>The result? Novel cage-like molecules composed of 60 carbon atoms, joined together to form a hollow sphere. The largest and most symmetrical form of pure carbon ever discovered.

                    How can buckyballs help cure aids? An enzyme (HIV-1-Protease) that is required for HIV to reproduce, exhibits a <span>nonpolar pocket</span> in its three-dimensional structure.

                    <br/>
                    On the model to the right, notice how the nonpolar Fullerene is growing to fit the exact diameter of the enzyme's binding pocket.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    If this pocket is blocked, the production of virus ceases. Because <span>buckyballs are nonpolar</span>, and have approximately the same diameter as the pocket of the enzyme, they are being considered as possible blockers.
